## Reactive in a nutshell

Developing reactive apps is harder especially for developers new to functional programming but it's worth it

* Easy to write concurrent code, no callback hell
* Declarative code with immutable structures
* Standard mechanism for error recovery 
* Back pressure
* Easy to scale
* Reduced resource consumption

But most of all, NodeJS developers cannot claim anymore that JVM sucks because it's blocking !
